# mmb
mookie's mini blog

make a blog using python only. fun.

i did not want to run mysql or php or whatever. i just wanted to write then render html files.

naming format of blog entry files:

YYYY-MM-DD-title.md

example:

2016-06-21-happy-birthday-to-mookie.md

edit the config.json file and put it in the location of blog entry files.

run this to render:

mmb.py -i INPUT_DIR
